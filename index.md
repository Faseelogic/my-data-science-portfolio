## Machine Learning & Regression Analysis

### 2. Advanced Housing Price Prediction

**Goal:** Developed a robust machine learning model to predict house sale prices based on a comprehensive dataset of residential properties, aiming for high accuracy in valuation.

**Summary of Work:**
- Performed extensive **data cleaning and feature engineering**, including handling missing values, transforming skewed features, and creating interaction terms.
- Utilized various regression techniques, including **XGBoost Regressor**, cross-validation, and hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
- Generated insightful visualizations to understand feature importance and model residuals.

**Results & Impact:**
- The final model achieved a competitive **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** of $X,XXX (e.g., $25,000) on the test set, demonstrating strong predictive power.
- The project provided valuable insights into key factors driving house prices, such as square footage, neighborhood, and year built.
